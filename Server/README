TiVo/HME/Server version 1.x
============================

Starts up a webserver & awaits connctions from a TiVo.
The URL is stripped & the path is taken as the class name.
SO a URL like http://localhost/myapp causes TiVo::HME::Server 
to load up 'myapp.pm' which is expected to be a subclass of
TiVo::HME::Application.  
Make sure you 'use lib qw(...)' or similar so it can find your app!
This is automatically installed via the TiVo::HME distribution.
