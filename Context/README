TiVo/HME/Context version 1.x
=============================

This object is just a bless'ed hash containing some important
values:
    'io' -> I/O stream to client (TiVo)
    'peer' -> packed sockaddr address of peer (perldoc -f getpeername)
    'cookie' -> ID of persistent data from client (TiVo)
    'request' -> HTTP::Request object

    This object is constructed by TiVo::HME::Socket as is passed to
    your application as a parameter to your 'init' function.
    It's also available to your app by calling $self->get_context

    You prolly do NOT want to mess w/the IO within the context.
